I looked up certain c++ functions and libraries online, mostly on Stack Overflow;
I tried to include the List Interface based on stuff I read in the book, but I wasn't sure how it was supposed to work with the rest of the code, sorry :/ ;
I had some assistance from Anna Greene and also my dad;
Please note that I tried to process multiple things on the same "tick" if they were all technically happening in the same "tick" (i.e. processing student's service time, accepting new students, sending students home) in order to keep the simulation as realistic as possible, so my output might be different from people who organized their simulation differently.
